# 🔒 Security Policy

## 🛡️ Security Overview

The security of Resona Music Platform was my top priority. I implemented industry-standard security practices and continuously monitor for vulnerabilities.

## 🚨 Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

- **Response Time**: Within 24 hours
- **Resolution Time**: Critical issues within 48 hours

### 📋 What to Include
When reporting a vulnerability, please provide:
- Detailed description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Any suggested fixes (if known)
- Your contact information

### 🔐 Responsible Disclosure
- **Do NOT** publicly disclose the vulnerability until it's been addressed
- **Do NOT** exploit the vulnerability beyond what's necessary to demonstrate it
- **Allow reasonable time** for the security team to address the issue

## 🛡️ Security Measures Implemented

### 🔑 Authentication & Authorization
- **JWT Tokens**: Secure token-based authentication with 7-day expiration
- **Password Hashing**: bcrypt with 12 salt rounds
- **Session Management**: Secure token refresh mechanism
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive server-side validation

### 🌐 Network Security
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: All connections encrypted in production
- **CORS Configuration**: Strict cross-origin resource sharing
- **Rate Limiting**: 1000 requests per 15-minute window
- **Security Headers**: Helmet.js with custom configuration

### 📁 File Upload Security
- **File Type Validation**: Audio (MP3, WAV, FLAC) and images only
- **File Size Limits**: 10MB for audio, 5MB for images
- **Path Sanitization**: Protection against directory traversal
- **Secure Storage**: Files stored in protected uploads directory

### 🗄️ Database Security
- **MongoDB Atlas**: Enterprise-grade cloud database
- **Connection Encryption**: SSL/TLS encrypted connections
- **Access Control**: Authenticated database access
- **Data Validation**: Mongoose schema validation

### 🖥️ Server Security Headers
```javascript
// Security headers implemented
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Content-Security-Policy: Configured for media streaming
Strict-Transport-Security: Enabled for HTTPS
```

## 🔍 Security Best Practices

### 🔑 Environment Configuration
```bash
# Generate secure JWT secret
JWT_SECRET=$(node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(64).toString('hex'))")

# Production security settings
NODE_ENV=production
BCRYPT_ROUNDS=12
RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS=100
```

### 🛡️ Development Guidelines
- Never commit `.env` files or secrets to version control
- Use environment variables for all sensitive configuration
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Implement proper error handling without information leakage
- Regular security dependency updates
